# 🛒 Naturns

Appointment app designed to manage bookings in an organized way. It allows you to add new appointments with client information and a service section (for example, nails or hairdressing). Appointments are automatically sorted by date and time.

## 📝 Technologies

- `React`
- `Typescript`
- `Tailwind`
- `Zustand`
- `useId`
- `Custom Hooks`


## 🧠 The Process
I've created this app inspired by my mom's job, aiming to simplify the organization of her appointments, not just by day, but also by time.
It allows users to describe the specific task to be done, depending on the section: Hair or Nails.
I implemented TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for a user-friendly design. I also built it using Zustand to handle actions like adding or deleting appointments.
